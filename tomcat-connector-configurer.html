This setting is present for compatibility with Tomcat 4.1.x, where the encoding specified in the contentType, or explicitly set using Request.setCharacterEncoding method was also used for the parameters from the URL. The default value is false.  Notes: 1) This setting is applied only to the query string of a request. Unlike URIEncoding it does not affect the path portion of a request URI. 2) If request character encoding is not known (is not provided by a browser and is not set by SetCharacterEncodingFilter or a similar filter using Request.setCharacterEncoding method), the default encoding is always \"ISO-8859-1\".

The acceptable values for the parameter is \"off\" (disable compression), \"on\" (allow compression, which causes text data to be compressed), \"force\" (forces compression in all cases), or a numerical integer value (which is equivalent to \"on\", but specifies the minimum amount of data before the output is compressed). If the content-length is not known and compression is set to \"on\" or more aggressive, the output will also be compressed. If not specified, this attribute is set to \"off\". Note: There is a tradeoff between using compression (saving your bandwidth) and using the sendfile feature (saving your CPU cycles). If the connector supports the sendfile feature, e.g. the NIO connector, using sendfile will take precedence over compression. The symptoms will be that static files greater that 48 Kb will be sent uncompressed. You can turn off sendfile by setting useSendfile attribute of the connector, as documented below, or change the sendfile usage threshold in the configuration of the DefaultServlet in the default conf/web.xml or in the web.xml of your web application."},{"name":"compressionMinSize","type":"integer","defaultValue":"2048","required":false,"description":"If compression is set to \"on\" then this attribute may be used to specify the minimum amount of data before the output is compressed.

The default value is 60000 (i.e. 60 seconds) but note that the standard server.xml that ships with Tomcat sets this to 20000 (i.e. 20 seconds).

The following values may used:  immediately - an intermediate 100 status response will be returned as soon as practical onRead - an intermediate 100 status response will be returned only when the Servlet reads the request body, allowing the servlet to inspect the headers and possibly respond before the user agent sends a possibly large request body."},{"name":"defaultSSLHostConfigName","type":"string","defaultValue":"_default_","required":false,"description":"The name of the default SSLHostConfig that will be used for secure connections (if this connector is configured for secure connections) if the client connection does not provide SNI or if the SNI is provided but does not match any configured SSLHostConfig.

Provided values are always converted to lower case."},{"name":"disableUploadTimeout","type":"boolean","defaultValue":"true","required":false,"description":"This flag allows the servlet container to use a different, usually longer connection timeout during data upload.

When this number has been reached, the server will accept, but not process, one further connection. This additional connection be blocked until the number of connections being processed falls below maxConnections at which point the server will start accepting and processing new connections again.

If not specified, this attribute is set to 200.

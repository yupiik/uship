The default value is false.  Notes: 1) This setting is applied only to the query string of a request. Unlike URIEncoding it does not affect the path portion of a request URI. 2) If request character encoding is not known (is not provided by a browser and is not set by SetCharacterEncodingFilter or a similar filter using Request.setCharacterEncoding method), the default encoding is always \"ISO-8859-1\".

If the content-length is not known and compression is set to \"on\" or more aggressive, the output will also be compressed. If not specified, this attribute is set to \"off\". Note: There is a tradeoff between using compression (saving your bandwidth) and using the sendfile feature (saving your CPU cycles). If the connector supports the sendfile feature, e.g. the NIO connector, using sendfile will take precedence over compression. The symptoms will be that static files greater that 48 Kb will be sent uncompressed. You can turn off sendfile by setting useSendfile attribute of the connector, as documented below, or change the sendfile usage threshold in the configuration of the DefaultServlet in the default conf/web.xml or in the web.xml of your web application."},{"name":"compressionMinSize","type":"integer","defaultValue":"2048","required":false,"description":"If compression is set to \"on\" then this attribute may be used to specify the minimum amount of data before the output is compressed.

[abstract]
Uship (µship) is a lightweight microservice stack for modern applications.

== Pre-requisites

. Ensure to use java >= 11
. (Optional) Ensure to use a dependency manager such as Apache Maven/Gradle/SBT or Apache Ivy.

TIP: using link:https://sdkman.io/[SDKMan] can greatly simplify the installation.

== Development stack

The goal of µShip is to promote and enable JSON-RPC development at scale.
For that it provides a CDI-Servlet integration module known as `jsonrpc-core` module.

However, µShip also provides all the underlying stack to make it functional such as:

* An embedded Servlet container (Apache Tomcat),
* JSON-P/JSON-B integration modules,
* JSON-RPC API/implementation and documentation utilities,
* A configuration module to easily inject properties.

TIP: as of today, µShip does not go further - as providing a configuration/openmetrics/opentracing/JWT integration since these ones can easily be added using CDI libraries.
It will probably be tackled in a few versions but was not a pre-requisite of the project.

== Deployment capabilities/integration

By using CDI standalone (a.k.a. CDI SE) and an embedded Apache Tomcat, µShip enables to deliver application as:

* Assemblies (just use `java -cp folder-with-dependencies-and-application-jars/*.jar com.app.YourMain` - or reuse µShip main),
* Docker images using `jib-maven-plugin`.

TIP: by using a flat classpath, µShip is perfectly compatible with java CDS which boosts a lot the startup in general, don't hesitate to set it up if you care to start in less than a second.

== Testing

Once again, by using a plain CDI base, testing is made easy and compatible with Apache OpenWebBeans tooling.

== HTTP Server

== HTTP Client

UShip extends the JVM `HttpClient` to provide a few more features and callbacks.
It also provides a Kubernetes client module which auto-setup a `HttpClient` from a POD.

== Persistence

UShip provides a convenient JDBC light mapper.

== Configuration

== Spring Boot

If you want a Spring Boot JSON-RPC integration, you can reuse our `jsonrpc-spring` module.

== Quarkus

If you want a Quarkus JSON-RPC integration, you can reuse our `jsonrpc-quarkus` module.

== Microprofile

If you want a Microprofile JSON-RPC integration, you can reuse our `jsonrpc-core` module with some minimal setup.

xref:microprofile.adoc[Read more.]

== CLI

`jsonrpc-cli` module enables to reuse the backend JSON-RPC programming style to write a CLI.
It flattenize the objects/lists/maps in a property style to enable to pass any option to the CLI.
This way you can reuse your "commands" from the command line or backend.

== Go further with GraalVM

You can also make your JSON-RPC (or web) server "native" thanks GraalVM.

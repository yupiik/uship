= Simple-configuration

A configuration is a class with field(s) decorated with `@Param`:

[source,java]
----
public class DataSourceConfiguration {
    @Param(description = "Driver to use", required = true)
    private String driver;

    @Param(description = "JDBC URL to use", required = true)
    private String url;

    @Param(description = "Database username.")
    private String username;

    @Param(description = "Database password.")
    private String password;
}
----

NOTE: fields are injected so they shouldn't be `final` but there is no constraint on having getters/setters.

TIP: `io.yupiik.uship.configuration.documentation.ConfigurationParameterCollector` class enables to extract all parameters for a batch and then map this extraction to a documentation if needed.

TIP: `simple-configuration` package enables to use this configuration without all the uship stack.

TIP: passing `yupiik.binder.unset` enables to make the configuration library to behave as if no configuration was passed to the value.
